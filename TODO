- Graphviz, GTK still not working on 7.6.1...

- Add repository to cabal (also in xdot)

- minimal view: like now
- full view: Add Menu, close button, legend, info at start, help
- interactively blend in and out:
  either single cloures or in general for all closures of a specific type (pattern matching?)

- return $ MVarClosure itbl (ptrs !! 0) (ptrs !! 1) (ptrs !! 2)
  in HeapView sometimes fails at (ptrs !! 0) (primes example with byte-code)
- Sometimes random hangs in ghc-vis?
- Check if pdf, png, svg, ps support in cairo activated at all, seems to be weird
